        The java program entry point is the main method if it is
        not present in the java class file then the program will
        not execute

        what is public --> the public access modifier is nothing
        but if any class or methods is public then it simply
        means that the class or method can be access from any file
        or any package or any other class

        so doesn't it make sense to make the main method public so
        that the java program can execute the method

        what is static --> the static keyword simply means that
        the property or method is independent of the object means it
        doesn't need any instance to be created jvm class loader
        initializer initialize the static property or methods present
        in the class

        for example population property of Human class is independent
        of the object it does not depend on the object, it is same
        for all

        what is void -->  void is a return type of the method
        the main method doesn't return anything it is just the
        entry point where our all java code will be present

        //important tips to remember

        primitive value are stored in the stack memory, where the
        non-primitive are stored in the heap memory and the variable
        reference to that object in the heap memory

        arrays are not stored in continuous memory allocation in java

        [1,2,3,4,5]

        here arr[i] are the reference variable that points to the
        actual object in the heap memory

        there is no copy by reference concept in the java, there is
        copy by the value of the reference

        however if there is one object and if two variable are
        referencing to the same object then any change by any variable
        can be seen to the other as the actual object is manipulated

        non-static methods cannot be called through the static method

        method overloading -->
        at compile time,if there are two or more than two method has
        the same name but different set of parameters or different
        parameter if they accept then that's called the method
        overloading

        method overriding -->
        at run time,if there are two or more than two method has
        the same name but different set of parameters or different
        parameter if they accept then that's called the method
        overloading

        constructor method -->
        constructor method in the class is used to initialize the
        object,
        there can be multiple constructor method in the class,
        but they should accept different set of parameters or
        different data type
        constructor name should be same as class name

        datatype -->
        something that cannot be broken down further is known as
        primitive

        primitives:
        int, short, long, char, byte, float, double

        Non primitives :
        String, com.jay.Array, Object
